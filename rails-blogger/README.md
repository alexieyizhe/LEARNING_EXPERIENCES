### About
RoR-blogger was a practice project I undertook in order to learn the basis of Ruby on Rails, to prepare for the [Rails recipe web app](https://github.com/alexieyizhe/easy-recipeasy) I was going to write (which in turn, was to prepare for an interview for a co-op opportunity at Flipp Corp).

### Retrospective
I followed [this great Rails tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html), adapting it to fit in pieces that I might require for my website in the future. Rails is awesome to work with, even for a student who was inexperienced with intermediate web development like me. I can definitely understand why some find Ruby to be the most developer-friendly programming language.
