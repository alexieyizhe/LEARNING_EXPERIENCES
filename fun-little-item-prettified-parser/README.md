### About
F.L.I.P.P was a chrome extension built to simplify one of the workflows and small annoying parts of working as part of the Indexing team at Flipp. We had a bunch of item strings, but no way of visualizing them easily.

### Retrospective
This was my first time making a chrome extension, and I was very frustrated at the lack of support and documentation for different aspects of the extension, like clipboard manipulation. However, with the help of my awesome partner @partialfractions, we were able to finish the extension. Semantic UI was also a lifesaver.
