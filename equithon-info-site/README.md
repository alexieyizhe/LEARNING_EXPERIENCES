### About
equithon-info-site was a practice project I undertook in order to learn the basis of AngularJS, in preparation for the [Ionic mobile app](https://github.com/alexieyizhe/eqrscanner) I wanted to create for Equithon.

### Retrospective
I thought it best that I had a fundamental understanding of the way AngularJS worked before trying to dive into Ionic, which was built on Angular. I had [some initial experience](https://github.com/alexieyizhe/easy-recipeasy) with Ruby on Rails, which is a similar MVC framework to Angular; this allowed me to get this project up and running relatively quickly. I found that [the Angular documentation/tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial) was immensely helpful.
