### About
shopify-challenge is a static webpage that's meant to mock a Shopify newsletter subscription page. As its name suggests, it was a coding challenge that I undertook as part of some prerequisites for an opportunity to interview for a co-op position at Shopify (I know, a lot of steps).

### Retrospective
Shopify's application for front end developer was due on Jan 12, 2018.  

The date I found out about the opportunity? Jan 11, 2018.  

My previous HTML/CSS/JS experience? Virtually nonexistent.

 What a recipe for success, eh? In the end, I was proud of what I ended up being able to accomplish given my skill level in web dev and the time crunch. Much was learned about CSS styling, Stack Overflow searching, and late night coding.
