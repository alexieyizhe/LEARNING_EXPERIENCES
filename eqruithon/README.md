### About
eQRuithon was an Ionic mobile app built for [Equithon](http://equithon.org/) 2018, a social innovation hackathon in Waterloo, ON. It was designed to as an event app for an attendee, whether it be a hacker, volunteer, sponsor, etc. It was to provide features like a dynamic schedule, interactive elements, and a map of the event.

### Retrospective
This project was archived as I realized it was too ambitious for what the timeline and resources allowed. I was working as an operations coordinator for the event and sadly, it was too much to juggle my responsibilities as well as develop a fully fledged site. In addition, we already had a fully functioning website and established plans for all the functionality that I imagined the site would provide.
